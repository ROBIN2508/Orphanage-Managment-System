                An orphanage is a place where children who do not have guardians who are capable of caring for them
                live. Some orphanages employ professionals like nurses, teachers, and other people involved in raising
                children in order to care for the children entirely within the orphanage. Others merely offer the
                children basic necessities like food and shelter and take care of education and other issues elsewhere.
                A child might be sent to an orphanage due to the death of the child's parents, or the parents may be
                alive but unwilling or unable to care for the child. Most orphanages work to place children in more
                traditional family environments, as these are seen as more secure and desirable than living in
                anorphanage.
            </p>
            <p class="p-3">
                Some orphanages are separated by gender, but many care for children of both genders. Typically, the
                orphanage building will include many aspects that might be found in a house, as well as several others.
                Rooms where the children sleep, a kitchen, and other related rooms are all likely to be found in an
                orphanage. If the orphanage also functions as a school, then a schoolroom is important as well.
